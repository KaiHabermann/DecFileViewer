# Data & Generated Files
# We exclude the large number of generated images and copies of dkfiles to keep the repo light
# But for GitHub Pages deployment, these need to be built/present.
# Usually, we'd commit the source code and have a CI/CD pipeline build the data.
# However, since the data generation is heavy (parsing 9500 files + images), 
# you might want to commit the result OR use a separate branch for deployment.
# For now, let's ignore the intermediate Python artifacts but KEEP the frontend public data 
# so the page can be deployed directly if built locally.

# If the repo size becomes an issue, add these to gitignore and use a release asset or external storage.
